# SocialMediaFastAPI
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.
FastAPI is a Web framework for developing RESTful APIs in Python. FastAPI is based on Pydantic and type hints to  validate, serialize, and deserialize data, and automatically autogenerate OpenAPI documents It fully supports asynchronous programming and can run with Uvicorn and Gunicorn.To improve developer-friendliness, editor support was considered from the earliest days of the project.
